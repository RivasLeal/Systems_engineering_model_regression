## Data Storage
### Why JSON?
Excel and CSV are very usual for storing data points, but in my personal experience with a JSON file
we can make the data more human readable. JSON will allow me to know that we are iterating over projects
with common fields, instead of having some files and manually filtering out columns or sections we don't need.
JSON allows us to have comments and in the future modify the code by looking for unique fields.
### How do I add data?
The Bread and Butter of the data is in the projects section which currently houses all projects that our 
hypothetical company currently utilizes. <br/><br/>
Each Project must have the following fields:
1) SLOC: Source Lines of Code
2) Development Time: The code will assume that any time you put in here is in YEARS
<br/><br/>

The following fields are optional:
1) N/A
